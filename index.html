<h2>What is the Association for Computing Machinery?</h2>

<p>The ACM is a professional organization that brings together computing
educators, researches, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share
resources, and address the field's challenges. It is the world's largest
computing society and supports the professional growth of its members by
providing opportunities for life-long learning, career development, and
professional networking. With nearly 100,000 members its growing membership
has led to Councils in Europe, India, and China, fostering network
opportunities that strengthen ties within and across countries and
technical communities.</p>
