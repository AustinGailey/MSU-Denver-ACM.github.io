    <h2>What is the Association for Computing Machinery?</h2>

    <p>The ACM is a professional organization that brings together computing
    educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share
    resources, and address the field's challenges. It is the world's largest
    computing society and supports the professional growth of its members by
    providing opportunities for life-long learning, career development, and
    professional networking. With nearly 100,000 members its growing membership
    has led to Councils in Europe, India, and China, fostering network
    opportunities that strengthen ties within and across countries and
    technical communities.</p>

    <p>As a student chapter within the Association for Computing Machinery, you
    will be provided with unique opportunities for networking, mentoring, and
    bonding over common interests.</p>
